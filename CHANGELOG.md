## 0.3.0 (2021/12/10)

BREAKING CHANGES:

* Deprecate the tfmigrate plan --out=tfplan option ([#63](https://github.com/minamijoyo/tfmigrate/pull/63))

Deprecate the tfmigrate plan --out=tfplan option without replacement and it will be removed in a future release.
It was based on a bug prior to Terraform 1.1 and doesn't work with Terraform 1.1 or later.
Fortunately, Terraform 1.1 added [a new moved block feature](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-1-1-improves-refactoring-and-the-cloud-cli-experience), so some use-cases could be covered by the moved block.

You can now keep track of which migrations have been applied and apply all unapplied migrations in sequence. The migration history can be saved to `local` or `s3` storage. See the `Configurations` section in the README for how to configure it.
If your cloud provider has not been supported yet, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. As a workaround, you can use `local` storage and synchronize a history file to your cloud storage with a wrapper script.

* Fix unstable tests ([#8](https://github.com/minamijoyo/tfmigrate/pull/8))
